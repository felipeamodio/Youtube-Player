# Youtube Player

It's a simple project to better understand how to work with youtube players

## ‚úîÔ∏è Techniques and technologies used

- `Using React Native with Expo`: The expo makes setting up the environment easy;
- `Use the library React Native Youtube-iframe`: A wrapper of the **Youtube-iframe API** built for react native.
 -   ‚úÖ Works seamlessly on both ios and android platforms
-   ‚úÖ Does not rely on the native youtube service on android (prevents unexpected crashes, works on phones without the youtube app)
-   ‚úÖ Uses the webview player which is known to be more stable compared to the native youtube app
-   ‚úÖ Access to a vast API provided through the iframe youtube API
-   ‚úÖ Supports multiple youtube player instances in a single page
-   ‚úÖ Fetch basic video metadata without API keys (uses oEmbed)
-   ‚úÖ Works on modals and overlay components
-   ‚úÖ Expo support

- `Use the ScreenOrientation from expo`: Screen Orientation is defined as the orientation in which graphics are painted on the device. For example, the figure below has a device in a vertical and horizontal physical orientation, but a portrait screen orientation.
